# Maria Elisa Amadasi

I am a Classical Archaeologist specializing in the study of the water supply systems of ancient Rome. I hold a BA, MA, and PhD in Classical Archaeology from Sapienza University of Rome, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship at the École Française de Rome.
During my MA, I concentrated my research on Roman aqueducts, with a specific focus on the Aqua Traiana, which was the subject of my master's thesis. Building on this foundation, my PhD research focused on Aqua Virgo, the oldest aqueduct still functioning in Rome. My work provided the first comprehensive, diachronic analysis of the aqueduct. Through a multidisciplinary approach, I was able to distinguish between original and later restored or reconstructed sections, both above ground and underground. This methodology not only deepened our understanding of the aqueduct’s construction and its water intake and distribution systems, but also enhanced our knowledge of the topographical evolution of Aqua Virgo over time.
During my post-doctoral fellowship at the École Française de Rome, I had the opportunity to contribute to the ANR-funded "FISTULAE" project, led by Professor Christian Rico. This project significantly enhanced my expertise in the field of ancient water distribution systems, with a specific focus on lead pipes (fistulae) from the archaeological sites of Ostia, Portus, and Rome.
My work began with an extensive review of both bibliographic and archival sources, laying the groundwork for a detailed analysis of the physical materials. I systematically examined various types of lead pipes and their inscriptions, as well as collected samples from several fistulae for further investigation. This hands-on research was complemented by archaeometric analyses aimed at determining the provenance of the lead and studying how the metal’s characteristics changed over time. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into the final stages of lead processing, the trade of lead materials, and the networks of artisans and merchants involved.

     Since the antiquity, paved roads, aqueducts and sewers have been integral to the development of urban societies, facilitating trade, promoting cultural exchange and enhanced the quality of civic welfare. The continuous and extensive enhancement of the road network and water supply system became a defining characteristic of the ancient Roman society. These engineering masterpieces, which shaped both the city and the countryside, enabled the growth of Rome and its expansion. Therefore, they are a key element for the understanding of the functioning of the imperial Roman society. Starting from the study of ancient, archival, antiquarian and cartographic sources and the most up-to-date studies on the city of Rome and its hinterland, the infrastructural system, both water and roads will be investigated. My goal is to identify and map, using GIS, the key infrastructure elements—such as roads, bridges, aqueducts, cisterns, wells, and drainage canals—that defined the city of Rome and its surroundings up to approximately 13 kilometres from the Servian Walls, spanning from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. This mapping will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the infrastructure systems in place during antiquity. Additionally, the integration of GIS technology with data from the broader IN-ROME sub-projects will offer deeper insights into the exploitation of the landscape and water resources, as well as the management and the usage of urban and suburban spaces. This approach will enhance our knowledge of how these areas were developed, maintained, and frequented over time, contributing to a more detailed picture of the city's infrastructure and environmental strategies in the ancient world.
