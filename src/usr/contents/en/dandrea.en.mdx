# Francesca D'Andrea

I am an archaeologist specializing in Greek and Roman archaeology and the history of art, ancient Roman topography, and Latin epigraphy. I began my studies at Sapienza University of Rome, where I obtained the B.A. and M.A. degrees in Classical Archaeology. The years of study and training in Rome were crucial for the development of my dual identity as a field archaeologist and an epigraphist. I developed my skills under the guidance of Clementina Panella at the excavation site on the northeastern slopes of the Palatine Hill and in the epigraphic storerooms under the guidance of Silvia Orlandi. My master’s thesis, focused on the archaeological and epigraphic study of a group of tombs discovered at Porta Maggiore, is the first result of this fruitful combination.

A postgraduate internship under the supervision of Rita Volpe at the Sovrintendenza Capitolina, allowed me to conduct research on the archaeological area of the Scipio’s Tomb and on hundreds of inscriptions stored in the depots, many of which were unpublished.

My studies continued at the Statale University of Milan, where I obtained a post-graduate diploma from the Specialization School in Archaeological Heritage. For my thesis in Roman Archaeology under the guidance of Fabrizio Slavazzi, I continued my research on the funerary landscape between the Appian and Latin Ways, and on the collection of antiquities at the Tomb of the Scipios that had formed there since the 19th century. During those years, I also began cultivating an interest in archival and antiquarian research, and in the

modern urban history of Rome. The results of this decade-long research have finally taken the form of a monograph published in 2023.

For my PhD, I once again changed cities, moving to Pisa after winning a bursary at the Scuola Normale Superiore. My doctoral project, supervised by Gianfranco Adornato, was dedicated to the topography of the Esquiline Hill, with the aim of reconstructing its peri-urban landscape and tracking its development and transformation dynamics between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. To achieve this, in addition to traditional sources, I used the open-source software QGIS to create a digital archaeological map.

At the Scuola Normale, I had the opportunity to participate in surveys in the territory of Locri and archaeological excavations in the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento. I collaborated on the OltrePlinio project by curating the bibliography and the monthly newsletter. In the same context, I won a post-doc position to create a GIS dedicated to mapping ancient literary sources on sites of Flavian Rome. In 2018, I spent a semester in Berlin as a Visiting Student at Freie Universität under the supervision of Monica Trümper. I participated in and organized conferences and workshops in Europe and the United States. In recent years, I also had the opportunity to expand my teaching experience by preparing lectures and seminars for students and doctoral candidates in courses taught by Gianfranco Adornato (SNS), Andrea Giardina (SNS), Daniele Manacorda (Roma Tre), and Antonino Facella (Genova).

In my work, I use a combination of archaeological, epigraphic, literary, antiquarian, and archival sources - enriched by the potential of digital tools - for the reconstruction of the ancient landscape and the political, social, religious, and cultural dynamics that shaped it over the centuries. I firmly believe in the importance of multidisciplinary research, shared knowledge, and open access, benefiting from the exchange of ideas among scholars from different disciplinary fields, countries, and cultures.

          My previous work focused on the analysis of the boundaries of Rome and on understanding the complex multifunctionality of a liminal landscape where funerary and residential areas, water infrastructure, productive and commercial spaces coexisted. These form the starting point for my work on IN-ROME. The research subject is the eastern and southeastern sector of Rome, from the Servian Walls in the west to the Ninth Mile in the east, from the Via Tiburtina in the north to the Via Labicana in the south. This is the only sub-project where we have chosen to limit the investigation to a defined and limited part of the suburb. This is due to the need to address key issues of Rome’s urban development and its countryside over time in a depth of analysis that would be impossible to extend to the entire project area. By proceeding mile by mile, I first investigate the dynamics of urban expansion beyond the Servian Walls, which resulted in the inclusion of the extra-urban sector of the Esquiline within the shifting boundaries of imperial Rome. The research then extends beyond the city to analyse how the built-up area gradually dissolved into a lively rural countryside.

         Attention is focused on the distribution of private properties (Roman horti) on the Esquiline with their political, economic, and social implications; on villas and their role in the functioning of the city and the suburb; on the presence of emperors in this area and the transition from private to imperial ownership; on water infrastructure and communication/transportation routes; on tombs, the topography of funerary areas, and their use. Building upon previous studies dedicated to various parts of this territory in the past, the goal is to gather and integrate data within their micro and macro context, with the aim of providing an overall picture of the history of the eastern periphery of Rome and its countryside. Archaeological, cartographic, and archival sources are used to offer a synchronic and diachronic reading of the constituent elements of the landscape; epigraphy and literary sources allow for the inclusion of voices and names in these spaces. In my studies, I have always treated inscriptions as written source and inscribed text, primarily seeking to return the artifact to its original context. This approach also guides me in the analysis of the eastern suburb of Rome, a territory rich in epigraphic finds that occupy a privileged position within the sources necessary to understand the functioning of the territory and, hopefully, to trace the actors who lived in and shaped it
