# Silvia Orlandi

As Associate Professor in Latin Epigraphy at Sapienza University of Roma since 2006, I have studied for about twenty years the inscriptions of the Roman world, in collaboration with the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma and other institutions. To the epigraphic materials of the Colosseum is dedicated one of my main research fields, whose results have been published in many articles and books, dealing not only with the building history of the monument, but also, and above all, with the senatorial aristocracy in the Late Empire, and, in general, with epigraphy in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. I also study the history of epigraphy as a discipline, and the Renaissance collections of antiquities, with particular attention to the epigraphic manuscripts by Pirro Ligorio, that have just been published for the first time, within the general project of the National Edition of his works. In the last years, much of my attention and effort has been paid to new technologies applied to the epigraphic research: I am the scientific director, together with Giuseppe Camodeca and Giovanni Cecconi, of the online epigraphic database EDR (Epigraphic Database Roma), and I have been the coordinator of the European project EAGLE (European network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy), funded by the European Commission (2013-2016). Since 2017 I am the President of the Association Internationale dâ€™Epigraphie Grecque et Latine (AIEGL).
