# Umberto Soldovieri

I am an archaeologist specialising in Greek and Roman epigraphy and antiquities. My education took place at the Universities of Salerno (2010, BA in Roman antiquities with a thesis on the inscriptions of the Sele and Tanagro Valleys) and Bari (2014, MA with a thesis on the epigraphic heritage of Salernum). At the University of Bari I also earned a PhD in Humanistic Studies (2019, 32th PhD cycle) with a dissertation on the Medieval trafficking of Roman urns in Campania. Currently I am co-editing the catalogue of Greek and Latin inscriptions preserved at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples together with Giuseppe Camodeca. In addition, as a part of the research team working at the Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR), I am responsible for the inventory of inscriptions from various ancient cities in southern Italy

        The main objective of WP 3 is to assess the actual historical and documentary value of inscriptions in relation to their context of provenance, when known. To this end, a re-evaluation of the main original sources of the manuscript and printed tradition of urban epigraphy will be carried out, attempting to demonstrate whether, and to what extent, texts, and especially those from 15th- to 18th-century, are reliable in providing information on the exact find spot of an artefact. The aim is also to trace the ways in which inscriptions were passed on between different collectors over the centuries. This critical re-examination, viewed in the light of the history of collecting more broadly, will complement the interpretterpreta distribution patterns of inscriptions in the Roman suburbium resulting from their mapping, in order to avoid potential biases created by excavation, collection, and pubblication histories.
