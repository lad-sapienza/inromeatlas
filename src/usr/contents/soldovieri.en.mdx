# Umberto Soldovieri

I am an archaeologist specialising in Greek and Roman epigraphy and antiquities. My education took place at the Universities of Salerno (2010, BA in Roman antiquities with a thesis on the inscriptions of the Sele and Tanagro Valleys) and Bari (2014, MA with a thesis on the epigraphic heritage of Salernum). At the University of Bari I also earned a PhD in Humanistic Studies (2019, 32th PhD cycle) with a dissertation on the Medieval trafficking of Roman urns in Campania. Currently I am co-editing the catalogue of Greek and Latin inscriptions preserved at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples together with Giuseppe Camodeca. In addition, as a part of the research team working at the Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR), I am responsible for the inventory of inscriptions from various ancient cities in southern Italy
