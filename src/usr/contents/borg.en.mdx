# Barbara Borg

My interest in contextual and topographical approaches to the ancient world was shaped significantly by my experience during a 12-month travel grant from the German Archaeological Institute. After completing my PhD in 1990, it allowed me to travel to archaeological sites and museums all around the Mediterranean. Suddenly everything fell into place: materials and subjects I had studied individually and separately became part of coherent cultures and lived ancient experiences. Later applying this approach to Roman funerary culture has allowed me to not only offer more comprehensive descriptions of ancient practices, but also to change considerably our understanding of their meaning and of the insights they provide us into social structures such as class relations and the role of the family.

A three-year Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship allowed me to test a new approach that turned out to become a kind of proof-of-concept study for IN-ROME. My project ‘Mapping the social history of Rome: a topographical approach to action and interaction in an ancient mega-city’ explored two interconnected methodological strands. The first one drew on concepts of Microhistory as the intensive and detailed study of a small area or limited group of people, but with the intent to answer (rather than just illustrate) more general (or even macro-historical) questions. While, so far, such research had been largely limited to historical enquiries of early modern and later periods due to the richness of documentary sources, my project drew instead on the widest possible range of evidence including, crucially, archaeological and epigraphical, to reach the critical level of source volume.

The second one, which has led to the concept of IN-ROME, proposed that topographical structures and patterns of activities can be translated into social ones by considering the real-life experience of physical proximity or distance between the people who carried out these activities. The project, which centred on an area of about four square miles around the third mile of the via Appia, yielded exciting results for the relationship between people of different religions and ethnicities, and for the development of early Christian cults within non-Christian surroundings in particular, which are currently being prepared for publication.
