# Clara Anne-Laure Hortense Durand

I am pursuing a PhD in Ancient Studies at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. In September 2021, I arrived in Italy through an Erasmus program at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa to validate the second year of my Master's degree, which I had started at the Ecole du Louvre in Paris, where I was trained in Art History and Museology. This opportunity solidified my desire to study Ancient Studies and remain in Italy to further my knowledge of the ancient world. My particular interests lie in Roman art and its developments in the Mediterranean world, which has led me to write a thesis on "The Role of Women in the Tombs of Imperial Rome."
